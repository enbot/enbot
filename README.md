# Enbot
Enbot is a working prototype for a course completion work created with the aim of analyzing the emotions present in a text, computes them and uses them to respond to the text entries. The work will be available [here](https://riuni.unisul.br/) soon.

## Dataset
The public dataset used in this project was created by [Praveen Govindaraj](https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi) and was not modified. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp) (visited on 2021/01/06).

## Requirements
To run the application in development mode you will have to be installed python 3+ and angular. A detailed description of the projects can be found [here](https://github.com/enbot/core) and [here](https://github.com/enbot/chat). If you just want to run the application without worrying about dependencies, a bundle project has been created [here](https://github.com/enbot/bundle) and you can run it with docker or similar easily.

## Goals
This project follows some guidelines:
* Analyze emotion in text entries;
* Use these emotions to create a profile;
* Use the created profile to respond to text entries;
* Have a preview of the prevailing feeling in the application.
